# Hey, I'm Colin 👋

**CTO & Founder at [Rooney Tech](https://rooneytech.com)** — Denver, CO

I build things at the intersection of mobile, machine learning, and hardware.

## What I'm Working On

**🏃 Run Fun** — iOS app for running gait analysis using on-device pose estimation. Helping runners improve form and reduce injury risk. *(Private repo — happy to chat about it!)*

**💡 Wearables** — Prototyping hardware for social/dating events and hospitality (bartenders & servers).

**🎓 ML Visions** — A meetup I run ~3x/month for people working on machine learning, computer vision, and creative tech projects. All skill levels welcome — come build, learn, or just hang out.
- 📅 1st & 3rd Mondays + Sunday between (6 days after 1st Monday)
- 📍 Currently hosted at [denhac](https://denhac.org) (Denver's hackerspace)
- 🔗 [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/denhac-hackerspace/)

## Tech I Work With

**Languages:** Swift, Python, JavaScript  
**ML/AI:** Custom model training, RAG, Vector DBs, Vision model fine-tuning
